# GTO Integration with Loyverse POS
For Shaw Singapore Malls ---> GTO Integration with Loyverse POS

Using Loyverse to hourly GTO to Shaw. At the moment, the daily total Loyverse sales figures + refund is correct. It is with the exception of the timing. Please use crontab (Linux) to run this python script. 

Please take note that in the next version, I will correct this reporting and also a streamlit portal to allow auto-upload the missing sales report.
